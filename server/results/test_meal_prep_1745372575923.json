  "raw": "Blimey! A chicken pot pie! An absolute classic comfort food. But let's take this higher, shall we? Let's elevate this dish to another bleeding level, making it healthier, but keeping it packed with amazing flavors. Trust me, it'll be simply stunning!\n\nGordon Ramsey's Healthier Roasted Chicken Pot Pie – 5 Portions\n\nHere's your bloody shopping list. Get quality ingredients or don't bother:\n\n- 5 skinless, boneless chicken breasts\n- 5 cups of fresh peas, shelled\n- 40 ounces of Crimini mushrooms, thinly sliced\n- 5 small onions, finely diced\n- 10 fresh carrots, thinly sliced\n- 5 tablespoons of grass-fed butter\n- 1 2/3 cups of whole grain flour\n- 10 cups of homemade low-sodium chicken stock \n- 1 1/4 cup of unsweetened almond milk\n- 5 tablespoons of fresh parsley, finely chopped\n- Himalayan sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper\n- 5 whole grain pie crusts\n- 1 egg for egg wash\n\nNow, let's get down to the nitty-gritty:\n\n1. First of all, preheat your oven to 375°F. Roast the chicken breasts with a touch of salt and pepper. Cook the damned chicken properly! We're not serving rubber tonight. Once done, shred it. \n\n2. Melt the bloody butter in a large pot over medium heat. Throw in your onions and carrots and sweat them out, about 8 minutes until they soften. \n\n3. Add your mushrooms. Cook those beautiful fungi for another 5 minutes.\n\n4. Sprinkle your whole grain flour over the vegetables. Cook it out – we're not making wallpaper paste here, it needs to lose that raw flour taste!\n\n5. Slowly pour in your chicken stock and almond milk, stirring like a madman until the mixture thickens.\n\n6. Add your roasted, shredded chicken, fresh peas, and parsley. Taste the damn thing and season with salt and pepper as needed.\n\n7. Line your pie dishes with the whole grain pie crusts. Pour in your filling, you don't want a soggy bottom now, do you?\n\n8. Top with the remaining crust. Be neat, crimp the edges to seal. Add a few slits on top to let the steam escape – we're cooking a pot pie, not setting up a steam room.\n\n9. Brush with beaten egg and bake for a stunning 25-30 minutes until the crust is golden brown. Patience, pal!\n\n10. Now, give it a rest! Let it cool for 10 minutes before you dig in.\n\nYou've now got a healthier and flavor-packed version of a chicken pot pie that still delivers comfort in spades.\n\nFor meal prep: Divide the pies into 5 portions. Store in a bloody cool refrigerator, not next to the bloody furnace! Store for up to 4 days. \n\nTo reheat, preheat the oven to 375°F and cook for 10-15 minutes until hot in the middle - we don't want it lukewarm – it's not a bloody salad! If you have to use a microwave, then fine, but do 2-3 minutes on high. \n\nRemember, don't ruin all your hard work with lousy reheating! God, this sounds bloody delicious! Now, get cooking!",
  "feedback": "Well, well, well! A chicken pot pie recipe! Let's have a butcher's at it, shall we? \n\nRight off the bat, I have to say, your original recipe isn't a complete disaster. You've got a decent handle on the basics. I love that you're using rotisserie chicken – a bloody good shortcut and an excellent way of adding flavor. And your method for developing the filling is bang on the money – browning the veggies, adding flour for thickness, and stirring in the broth slowly to avoid lumps. All of that is spot on.\n\nBut honestly, mate, it's a chicken pot pie, not a chicken pot disaster! There are a few things you've overlooked, and that's where I come in. \n\nFirstly, frozen peas? Come on! You're better than that. Fresh peas are an absolute must. They're sweeter, brighter, and add a proper pop of color and texture. Same goes for the mushrooms – swap those plain ones for Crimini. They're a little more mature, giving your pot pie a much-needed depth of flavor. \n\nNext, let's talk about your pie crust. In a dish where the crust plays such a pivotal role, you're using store-bought? No, no, no! Make your own. It's not rocket science. And please, for the love of God, use whole grain flour. Adds a nutty flavor and it's better for you.\n\nSpeaking of health, you're practically bathing the vegetables in heavy cream. Let's lighten it up a bit. Replace the heavy cream with almond milk - it's creaminess without the calories. \n\nNow, onto my version. I've replaced your rotisserie chicken with skinless, boneless chicken breasts. Roasting them first locks in the juices and makes the chicken moist and tender. Also, I've upped the proportions because, let's face it, who doesn't love leftovers?\n\nI've used fresh peas, Crimini mushrooms and made my own whole grain pie crust. It's healthier and tastier. And instead of heavy cream, I've used unsweetened almond milk. It's lighter, but still gives the filling a nice, creamy consistency.\n\nFinally, I've added an egg wash to the crust. This gives it a beautiful, glossy finish and helps the crust brown evenly. Presentation is key, remember?\n\nIn terms of health, my version is significantly lighter. Less fat, lower sodium and more fiber. But don't worry, it's still packed full of flavor. And that, my friend, is how you make a chicken pot pie that's not only delicious but also bloody good for you! \n\nRemember, a great chef always knows how to balance taste and nutrition. Food is fuel, but it can bloody well taste fantastic too. Now, get back in the kitchen and give it another go! You've got this.",
  "groceryList": "**Gordon Ramsay's Bloody Brilliant Shopping List**\n\n**Meat Section:**\n1. 5 free-range, skinless, boneless chicken breasts. Don't you dare settle for anything less than quality. The chicken should be firm, not flabby, and have a good, clean smell. \n\n**Produce Section:**\n1. 5 cups of fresh peas, shelled. Look for bright green, plump, and firm peas for the crispiest texture. \n2. 40 ounces of Crimini mushrooms, thinly sliced. The mushrooms should be firm, plump, and unblemished. Don't you dare pick up shriveled or slimy ones!\n3. 5 small onions, finely diced. Go for firm onions with a crisp, dry outer skin.\n4. 10 fresh carrots, thinly sliced. The carrots should be firm and smooth - no cracks or dry spots, you hear me?\n5. 5 tablespoons of fresh parsley, finely chopped. The leaves should be vibrantly green and not wilted.\n\n**Dairy Section:**\n1. 5 tablespoons of grass-fed butter. Organic, unsalted variety is what you should be aiming for.\n\n**Dry Goods Section:**\n1. 1 2/3 cups of whole grain flour. Store in a cool, dry place and use within the bloody use-by date.\n2. 10 cups of homemade low-sodium chicken stock. If you're not making your own (which you bloody well should be), then go for organic, low-sodium varieties.\n3. 1 1/4 cup of unsweetened almond milk. Pick one with no added sugars or unnecessary additives.\n4. Himalayan sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Don't skimp on the quality of your seasoning, it'll make or break the dish.\n5. 5 whole grain pie crusts. Go for fresh, not frozen, and check for a use-by date that's as far away as possible.\n6. 1 egg for egg wash. Free-range, organic eggs are what you need.\n\n**Chef's Notes:** For the chicken, look for the highest welfare you can find - free-range and organic is best. Make sure your vegetables are fresh - the fresher they are, the better the flavor. Don't shy away from asking the produce manager when they were delivered. If they can't answer - find a new shop!\n\n**Specialty Items:** If you can't find whole grain pie crusts, feel free to substitute with normal pie crusts, but be aware you are sacrificing some of the health benefits. \n\nRemember, we're aiming for the best, so don't you dare cut corners. Quality ingredients are the key to a bloody good dish! Now, stop reading this and start shopping!",
  "instructions": "Right, listen up, you donkeys!\n\nStep 1: Start by cranking your oven up to a scorching 375°F. Grab those chicken breasts, season them with a decent pinch of salt and pepper - don't be stingy! Now, roast those bloody chickens 'til they're cooked but still juicy - about 20-25 minutes. No rubber chicken tonight, I swear! When done, shred it. Be precise, not like you're tearing apart last week's newspaper!\n\nStep 2: Get a large pot - no, not a bloody saucepan - a pot! Over medium heat, melt your butter until it's frothy. Toss in your onions and carrots, and let them sweat for about 8 minutes 'til they're nice and soft. Don't burn them, we're not making charcoal!\n\nStep 3: Now, in go your mushrooms. Cook these magical little fungi for another 5 minutes. Yes, they shrink, that's what they're supposed to do!\n\nStep 4: Sprinkle your whole grain flour over the lot. Cook it out, you're making a roux, not a bloody glue factory! Let it lose that raw flour taste - about 2 minutes should do it.\n\nStep 5: Now, slowly pour in your chicken stock and almond milk. Stir the bloody thing until your arm falls off - or until the mixture thickens, whichever comes first!\n\nStep 6: Chuck in your roasted, shredded chicken, fresh peas, and parsley. Now taste the damn thing and season with more salt and pepper if needed. If you don't taste, how will you know?!\n\nStep 7: Line your pie dishes with the whole grain crusts. Pour in your filling. Don't create a soggy mess - make sure you've got enough filling!\n\nStep 8: On goes the remaining crust. Fold it neatly, crimp the edges to seal. Cut a few slits on top - we're making a pot pie, not a bloody sauna!\n\nStep 9: Brush with beaten egg and bake for 25-30 minutes 'til the crust is golden brown. Don't open the oven every 2 minutes - patience!\n\nStep 10: Let it rest! Give it 10 minutes before you start digging in. No, I don't care if you're starving, wait!\n\nFor meal prep: Divide the pies into 5 equal portions. Store in a bloody cool refrigerator, not next to the bloody radiator! Keep for up to 4 days. \n\nTo reheat, warm up the oven to 375°F and cook for 10-15 minutes until hot in the middle. This isn't a bloody salad, it needs to be hot! If you're using a microwave, fine, but do 2-3 minutes on high. \n\nRemember, don't ruin all your hard work with lousy reheating! Now, get off your arse and start cooking!",

  "storage": "Right, listen up, you absolute donkeys. Your chicken pot pie masterpiece doesn't end when it comes out of the oven. Storing and reheating are just as bloody critical. \n\nTo store these pies, first, let them cool down. Don't you dare try to shove a hot pie in the fridge, you'll raise the bloody temperature and risk spoiling everything inside. And don't leave them out for more than 2 hours. We're not trying to breed bacteria here!\n\nOnce cooled, place each pie in a bloody airtight container. I'm not talking about your old takeaway boxes. Use glass or BPA-free plastic containers with tight-fitting lids. Don't skimp on quality or you'll ruin your delicious pies. \n\nDon't stack the containers. You're not building a tower, mate! Allow the cold air to circulate around the containers to maintain an even temperature. Store them in the fridge, not the bloody freezer. We're not making ice lollies.\n\nPay attention now. The fridge should be set below 40°F, but these pies are best enjoyed within 3-4 days. After that, the quality will start to drop faster than your hopes of becoming a Michelin-starred chef!\n\nFor reheating, take the pie out of the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Preheat your oven to 375°F and reheat for 10-15 minutes until hot, not just warm, right in the bloody middle. Stick a knife in the center, pull it out, and touch it to your lip. If it's hot, it's ready. If it's not, put the damned pie back in the oven!\n\nIf you absolutely have to use a microwave, then fine, but do it properly. Cover the pie with a microwave-safe lid or vented cling film. Reheat on high for 2-3 minutes, then let it rest for a minute to evenly distribute the heat. \n\nRemember, food safety is just as important as taste. Don't let poor storage or reheating ruin your masterpiece. We're chefs, not bloody savages!"
