      "raw": "Right, let's get cracking on this chicken pot pie, shall we? Bloody hell, the chatter in that recipe is enough to make you lose your appetite. No need to worry though, I'll cut through all the fluff and give you a knockout version of a chicken pot pie that's leaner, meaner, and ready to prep for the week ahead. Get ready for a classic dish with a Ramsay twist. \n\nFirst, let's get our ingredients sorted. \n\n**Grocery List:**\n- 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts (organic if possible)\n- 5 large carrots\n- 5 medium yellow onions\n- 20 ounces of cremini mushrooms\n- 15 large cloves of garlic\n- 1 bunch of fresh parsley\n- 2 cups of frozen peas\n- 2 containers of low sodium chicken broth \n- Greek yogurt (full fat)\n- 10 whole wheat pie crusts (store-bought is fine, time is of the essence!)\n- 1 dozen large eggs\n- Coarse salt and black pepper\n- Olive oil, butter (preferably grass-fed), and all-purpose flour \n\n**Meal Prep Cooking Steps:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F. On a baking tray, season your chicken breasts with salt, pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Roast for 20-25 minutes until fully cooked. Let it cool, and shred it.\n\n2. While the chicken is roasting, peel and thinly slice your onions. Next, top and tail, peel and slice your carrots. Half your mushrooms and slice them too. \n\n3. Get a large pot on medium heat. Add a bit of olive oil and a knob of butter — don’t go overboard with the butter, we're trying to keep it lean.\n\n4. Once the butter has melted, chuck in your onions and carrots. Let them soften for about 10 minutes. Stir occasionally, but let them do their thing.\n\n5. Now introduce your mushrooms to the pot, along with your finely chopped garlic. Keep stirring and let them cook for another 5 minutes.\n\n6. Sprinkle in 1/3 cup of flour all over, stirring constantly for 2 minutes. This is your roux and it's going to thicken up your sauce beautifully.\n\n7. Now, pour in 2 cups of chicken broth and stir. To make things a tad healthier, swap your heavy cream for a dollop of full fat Greek yogurt. Give it a good mix until it's simmering and thickened up into a lovely gravy.\n\n8. At this point, add in your shredded chicken, a cup of peas, and a handful of chopped parsley. Stir until everything is well coated with the sauce.\n\n9. Now we're ready to assemble our pies. For each pie, take a pie crust and line your pie pan. Fill it with the chicken mixture, top with another pie crust, and crimp the edges to seal it. Use a fork to prick some holes on top to let the steam escape.\n\n10. Beat an egg, and brush it over the top of the pie. Sprinkle some coarse salt and freshly cracked black pepper. \n\n11. Repeat this for each pie, then shove them in the oven for 30-35 minutes, until they're golden. \n\n12. Once done, let them cool before storing them in the fridge. \n\nWhen you’re ready to eat, reheat in the oven at 200°C/400°F for 20 minutes. Job done! \n\nNow, that's a bloody good chicken pot pie if I say so myself! Enjoy, and remember, don't skimp on the seasoning, it’s not rocket science, it's just cooking!",
      "feedback": "The original recipe provided by Natasha is a classic take on the chicken pot pie, highlighting the comforting nature of this dish. She provides clear instruction and pays attention to safety in the kitchen, particularly when cutting vegetables. Natasha's use of a homemade pie crust and rotisserie chicken both add depth to the dish's flavor profile.\n\nHowever, there's room for improvement. Natasha does not provide a clear list of ingredients or quantities, making it difficult to follow. She could also provide more precise cooking times for each step, which would make the recipe easier for beginners. \n\nGordon Ramsay's review and improvement of the recipe introduces some significant alterations. Firstly, he provides a clear, concise list of ingredients with exact quantities. This organizational aspect is beneficial for all cooks, especially beginners. He also introduces some healthy substitutions, such as using Greek yogurt instead of heavy cream, and boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of rotisserie chicken. These changes reduce the fat content of the dish without compromising on flavor, resulting in a leaner, healthier meal.\n\nRamsay's use of whole wheat pie crusts is another healthier choice, providing additional fiber. He also recommends using olive oil and grass-fed butter, both of which are healthier alternatives.\n\nIn terms of technique, Ramsay stresses the importance of seasoning the chicken before roasting it, which will enhance the flavor. He also provides clearer cooking times and temperatures, making it easier to follow the recipe and achieve consistent results.\n\nOverall, Ramsay's improvements make the recipe healthier, easier to follow, and potentially more flavorful due to the additional seasoning. His recipe also emphasizes meal prepping, making it a great choice for busy individuals who want to prepare their meals in advance.\n\nThe original recipe, while comforting and flavorful, could benefit from these improvements for a healthier, more organized, and easy-to-follow cooking experience.",

      "instructions": "Enhanced Instructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F. Arrange five chicken breasts on a baking tray. Season each breast evenly with salt and pepper. Drizzle each with approximately one teaspoon of olive oil. Roast in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Once cooked, remove from the oven and allow to cool. Once cool, shred the chicken finely, ensuring even pieces for a consistent texture in each pie.\n\n2. As the chicken is roasting, prepare your vegetables. Peel and thinly slice five onions. Top and tail, peel and slice five carrots into thin rounds for even cooking. Halve and slice 20 mushrooms. The thin slicing allows for quicker cooking and more even distribution in the pie filling.\n\n3. Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add two tablespoons of olive oil and a tablespoon of butter — this combination allows for a leaner dish whilst still adding flavor. \n\n4. Once the butter has melted, add the prepared onions and carrots to the pot. Allow them to soften for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. This process is known as sweating and it helps to release the flavors of the vegetables without browning them.\n\n5. Add the sliced mushrooms and five cloves of finely chopped garlic to the pot. Stir continuously and allow them to cook for another 5 minutes.\n\n6. Gradually sprinkle in 1/3 cup of flour, stirring constantly for 2 minutes. This technique forms a roux, which will thicken the sauce and give it a smooth texture.\n\n7. Slowly pour in 2 cups of chicken broth, stirring as you add. To make the dish healthier, substitute the heavy cream with a quarter cup of full fat Greek yogurt. Stir until the mixture comes to a simmer and thickens into a gravy-like consistency.\n\n8. Now, add the shredded chicken, a cup of peas, and a handful of chopped parsley. Mix well until all ingredients are coated with the sauce.\n\n9. To assemble the pies, line five pie pans with pie crust. Fill each with an even amount of the chicken mixture. Top each with another pie crust, crimping the edges to seal it. Use a fork to prick some holes on top to allow steam to escape during baking.\n\n10. Beat one egg, and brush it over the top of each pie for a glossy finish. Sprinkle each pie with coarse salt and freshly cracked black pepper for added flavor. \n\n11. Bake the pies in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, until they're golden brown. \n\n12. Once done, allow the pies to cool completely before storing them in the refrigerator. \n\nWhen you’re ready to eat, reheat a pie in the oven at 200°C/400°F for 20 minutes. \n\nRemember, seasoning is key to a flavorful dish, so don't hold back. Enjoy your perfectly prepped and delicious chicken pot pies!",

      "storage": "**Storage Instructions for Chicken Pot Pie:**\n\n1. Once the chicken pot pies have cooled down completely, you can get started on storage. It's crucial to let them cool first to prevent condensation within the storage container, which can lead to sogginess.\n\n2. For storage, you'll need airtight, microwave-safe glass containers that can accommodate the size of your pies. Glass is preferable as it doesn't absorb smells or stains and is more durable long-term. If your pies are too large, you may slice them into halves or quarters for easier storage.\n\n3. Before placing the pies in the containers, wrap each pot pie in aluminum foil. This will help to keep the pie crust crispy. \n\n4. Place each wrapped pie in its own container and secure the lid tightly. Make sure there is no air leakage to prevent freezer burn if storing in the freezer.\n\n5. Label each container with the date of preparation. This is good practice for meal prepping, helping you keep track of when the pies should be consumed.\n\n**Storage Duration:**\n\n1. In the refrigerator, the chicken pot pies will last for 3-4 days.\n\n2. In the freezer, they can be stored for up to 3 months. For best quality, consume within this timeframe, though they will remain safe to eat beyond this if kept continuously frozen.\n\n**Reheating Instructions:**\n\n**Microwave:**\n\n1. If stored in the refrigerator, remove the aluminum foil and place the pie in a microwave-safe dish. Cover with a microwave-safe lid or microwave-safe plastic wrap. Heat on high for 2-3 minutes, then let it stand for a minute before checking if it's heated through. If not, continue heating in 1-minute intervals.\n\n2. If frozen, it's best to thaw the pie in the refrigerator overnight before microwaving. If you need to heat from frozen, use the defrost setting until the pie is thawed, then follow the steps above.\n\n**Oven:**\n\n1. For reheating in the oven, preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F. \n\n2. If the pie is refrigerated, leave the pie in the aluminum foil, place it on a baking sheet, and heat for 15-20 minutes, or until the pie is heated through.\n\n3. If the pie is frozen, you can heat it directly from the freezer. Keep the pie in the aluminum foil, place it on a baking sheet, and heat for 50-60 minutes, or until heated through.\n\n**Storage Tips:**\n\n1. To maintain quality, avoid frequent temperature changes. Don't re-freeze once thawed.\n\n2. To preserve the crust's texture, reheat in the oven when possible. The microwave might make the crust soggy.\n\n3. For safety, always ensure the pie is heated through before eating. The internal temperature should reach at least 74°C/165°F. Use a food thermometer"
