A chicken pot pie is a comforting classic, but we can make it healthier and suitable for meal prep without sacrificing the flavor. Let's get cracking. Here's your grocery list for 5 portions: - 1 rotisserie chicken (you can use a whole cooked chicken for a healthier option) - 400g of button mushrooms - 5 medium yellow onions - 10 medium carrots - 15 garlic cloves - 1 bunch of fresh parsley - 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour - 10 cups of low sodium chicken broth - 2.5 cups of almond milk (a lighter alternative to heavy cream) - 10 teaspoons of sea salt (to taste) - 1 1/4 teaspoons of black pepper (to taste) - 5 cups of frozen peas - 5 discs of pie crust - 5 large eggs (for the wash) - Coarse salt and black pepper (to top each pie) Now, let’s get down to the nitty-gritty: 1. Shred your cooked chicken into bite-size pieces. We're not messing around here; you want nice, juicy chunks of chicken, not stringy scraps. 2. Slice your mushrooms, chop your onions, slice your carrots, and mince your garlic. Remember, we're not running a bloody marathon here–take your time to get the sizes right. Uniformity is key for even cooking. 3. Now, light up your stove and get your large pot or Dutch oven heated up–we're about to make magic happen. Melt a tablespoon of butter and sauté your onions and carrots until they're soft and singing. 4. Toss in your mushrooms and garlic, sauté until the mushrooms are soft–they'll shrink down, don't worry. 5. Sprinkle your flour over the vegetables and stir constantly for about 2 minutes until golden in color. You're making a roux, darling–this is what will thicken up our sauce. 6. Pour in your chicken broth and almond milk. Stir until it's a thick gravy consistency. Don't muck this up–it's key to a good pie. 7. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then toss in your shredded chicken, peas, and parsley. Stir it all up and remove from heat. 8. Roll out your pie crust and fit it into your individual pie dishes. Pour in your heavenly filling, then roll your second disc of pie crust to cover it. 9. Crimp your edges beautifully, and cut a few slits in the top for steam to escape. Brush with a beaten egg, and sprinkle with coarse salt and pepper. 10. Blast it in the oven at 220°C (about 425°F) for about 30 to 35 minutes or until golden. If it browns too quickly, cover it with foil. For meal prep: Once cooked, let them cool. Cover them in an airtight container–they'll keep in the fridge for up to 5 days. When you're ready to eat, reheat in the oven at 180°C (about 350°F) for 15 minutes. Trust me; these will taste bloody good every single time. So, there you have it — a revamped, healthier chicken pot pie recipe that's perfect for meal prep. Now, get in there and start cooking!",
  "feedback": "The original recipe of the chicken pot pie is well explained and easy to follow. The use of everyday ingredients makes it accessible to most cooks, and the step-by-step guide to prepping vegetables and chicken is extremely helpful. Natasha's tip of using a roux made of flour and butter to thicken up the sauce is traditional and effective. However, there are a few areas that could be improved. The use of heavy cream and a large amount of butter can make the dish quite rich and potentially unhealthy. Also, using store-bought rotisserie chicken might introduce unnecessary sodium, preservatives or unhealthy fats depending on how the chicken was prepared. Gordon Ramsay's improvements are beneficial in several ways. He replaces the heavy cream with almond milk, reducing the fat content and making the dish healthier. He also suggests using a whole cooked chicken instead of rotisserie chicken, allowing for better control of the ingredients and potentially reducing the sodium content. Uniform chopping of vegetables, as suggested by Gordon, ensures even cooking and better texture. His idea of using individual pie dishes is great for portion control and makes it suitable for meal prep. The use of an egg wash gives the pie a shiny, appealing finish, and sprinkling with coarse salt and pepper adds to the flavor and presentation. health considerations, Gordon's version is likely lower in saturated fat due to the reduced butter and heavy cream. His suggestion of using low sodium chicken broth also helps keep the sodium content in check. both recipes have their merits, but Gordon's improvements provide a healthier alternative with the same comforting taste. His attention to detail in cooking techniques, like uniform chopping and careful seasoning, can elevate the final dish.",

  "storage": "Storing Chicken Pot Pie: 1. Let the pot pies cool completely before storing. This helps to prevent the growth of bacteria. 2. Once cooled, place each pie in an individual airtight container. Glass containers with locking lids are recommended for their ability to maintain temperature and prevent leakage. 3. If you're storing in the refrigerator, place the containers on a middle or upper shelf where the temperature is most consistent. The pies will keep for up to 5 days. 4. For longer storage, you can freeze the pies. First, wrap each airtight container in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn. Label each with the date and place them in the freezer. They can be stored for up to 3 months. Reheating Chicken Pot Pie: 1. For reheating in the oven, preheat the oven to 180°C (about 350°F). Remove the pot pie from the container and place it on a baking sheet. Heat for 15 minutes or until warmed through. 2. If reheating in the microwave, remove the lid from the container. Cover the top of the pie loosely with a microwave-safe plate or microwave-safe plastic wrap. This helps to keep the crust from getting soggy. Heat on high for 2-3 minutes, then let it sit for 1 minute before checking the temperature. If it's not hot enough, continue heating in 30-second intervals until it's warmed through. Tips for Maintaining Quality and Safety: 1. Always cool your pot pies completely before storing. Storing hot food can cause condensation in the container, which can lead to soggy crust and the growth of bacteria. 2. Avoid reheating your pot pie more than once. Each time you reheat food, it passes through the \"danger zone\" temperatures where bacteria can grow. 3. When reheating, always ensure the pot pie reaches a minimum internal temperature of 74°C (165°F) to ensure any potential bacteria are killed. 4. If you've frozen your pot pie, it's best to thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before reheating. This ensures even reheating and reduces the risk of bacterial growth. 5. If you're unsure whether a stored pot pie is still good, check for any signs of spoilage such as a sour smell, mold, or a change in color or texture. When in doubt, throw it out."
