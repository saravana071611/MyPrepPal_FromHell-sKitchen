      "raw": "**Improved Chicken Pot Pie Recipe**\n\nRight, let's take this ultimate chicken pot pie recipe and do a Ramsay-style upgrade, making it healthier, but bloody delicious, and suitable for meal prep. We'll maintain the core of this classic dish but we're going to cut down on the butter and heavy cream, bulk up the veg, and introduce some whole grains.\n\n**Grocery List for 5 Portions**\n\n- 1 large rotisserie chicken\n- 1 pound of brown or white mushrooms\n- 2 large yellow onions\n- 4 medium carrots\n- 6 large garlic cloves\n- 1 bunch of fresh parsley\n- 2 cups of frozen peas\n- 1 cup of chicken broth\n- 1 cup of low-fat milk\n- Whole wheat flour (1/3 cup and additional for dusting)\n- Whole grain pie crusts (2 discs)\n- Olive oil (6 tablespoons)\n- Salt and Black pepper\n- 1 large egg\n\n**Meal Prep Cooking Steps for 5 Portions**\n\nPull apart that rotisserie chicken using two forks, shredding its meat into bite-sized pieces, and discard the skin. Blimey, it's noiseless. That should yield you about 4 cups of shredded chicken.\n\nGet chopping on those mushrooms, onions, carrots, and garlic. Remember, always respect your knife – safety first! For the parsley, finely chop it to get 1/4 cup.\n\nIn a large pot – a Dutch oven if you have one, heat 6 tablespoons of olive oil instead of butter. Add your onions and carrots and sauté them for about 8 minutes until softened. Next, throw in the mushrooms, and minced garlic, and continue sautéing for another 5 minutes until the mushrooms are softened.\n\nThen, you're going to add 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour, stirring constantly like your life depends on it for about 2 minutes. The flour should have a nice golden hue to it. \n\nPour in 2 cups of chicken broth and then add 1 cup of low-fat milk instead of heavy cream. Bring this beauty to a simmer and keep stirring until it thickens into a lush gravy consistency.\n\nSeason with 2 teaspoons of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper to taste. Now, add in the shredded chicken, frozen peas, and chopped parsley and give it all a big stir.\n\nYour pie filling is now ready – let it cool down a bit while we handle the pie crusts. Now, you can use store-bought whole grain pie crusts or make your own, but make sure it's properly chilled.\n\nRoll out one chilled pie crust disc into a 12-inch diameter circle on your lightly floured work surface. Transfer it gently into your pie pan, allowing a bit to hang over the edges.\n\nPour in the pot pie filling, spreading it out evenly. Roll out the second pie crust into a 10-inch circle, and place it over top of the pie filling, tucking the top crust under the bottom crust, giving it a lovely crimped edge.\n\nPierce it, five or six times, with a knife to create vents for steam to escape. Brush the top with a beaten egg to give it that golden touch when baked.\n\nBake it in a preheated oven at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 30-35 minutes until the top crust is a beautiful golden brown. If it's browning too quickly, just cover it with a bit of foil.\n\n**Storing and Reheating**\n\nAfter the pie has cooled, cut it into 5 even portions. Store each in a separate container in the fridge. When you're ready to eat, reheat in the microwave for 2-3 minutes or until hot throughout.\n\nThere you go, a healthier version of chicken pot pie that's perfect for meal prep. Remember, this isn't just food; it's a bloody art form! Now, get cooking!",
      "feedback": "**Original Recipe Feedback:**\n\nThe original recipe from Natasha's Kitchen provides a cozy and familiar rendition of a classic chicken pot pie. The use of rotisserie chicken cuts down on preparation time, while the variety of vegetables used ensures a mix of nutrients and flavors. The homemade pie crust is a nice touch, potentially offering better taste and texture than a store-bought version.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the original recipe could be improved. Firstly, the heavy use of butter and cream contributes to a high fat and calorie content. Secondly, the use of all-purpose flour and a traditional pie crust lacks whole grains, which are beneficial for fiber content and overall nutrition.\n\n**Gordon Ramsay's Improvements:**\n\nGordon Ramsay's version of the recipe addresses some of the health concerns of the original. The use of olive oil instead of butter, and low-fat milk instead of heavy cream significantly reduces the saturated fat content. These substitutions can aid in maintaining heart health without sacrificing too much on flavor or texture.\n\nRamsay also adds whole grains via the whole wheat flour and whole grain pie crusts, which adds fiber to the dish, contributing to better digestion and overall health. Increasing the amount of vegetables used also boosts the nutritional profile of the dish, while the use of rotisserie chicken remains, maintaining the convenience factor.\n\nIn terms of technique, Ramsay’s recipe is quite similar to the original, with both employing a sautéing method for the vegetables and a roux-based technique for the sauce. However, Ramsay includes an extra step of making vents in the pie crust before baking, which can prevent the crust from becoming soggy by allowing steam to escape.\n\nLastly, Ramsay's recipe includes storage and reheating instructions, transforming this recipe into a meal prep option, which is a great addition for busy individuals who want to enjoy a wholesome homemade meal throughout the week.\n\nIn summary, Gordon Ramsay's improvements offer a healthier version of the chicken pot pie which is just as flavorful as the original, while also providing a practical solution for meal prep.",
