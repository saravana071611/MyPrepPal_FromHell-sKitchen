      "raw": "Right, let's turn this dish into a proper prep meal, while making it healthier and maintaining all that delicious flavour. I'll do my best to refrain from telling you to throw it in the bin, but, bloody hell, loads of butter and heavy cream? We can definitely make this more waistline-friendly.\n\n**Here's the updated recipe:**\n\n**Grocery list:**\n\n1. 1.25 kg of skinless chicken breasts\n2. 500 g of white or brown mushrooms\n3. 5 medium yellow onions\n4. 10 medium carrots\n5. 15 garlic cloves\n6. 1 bunch fresh parsley\n7. 2 cups frozen peas\n8. 1.65 cups of all-purpose flour\n9. 10 cups of low-sodium chicken broth\n10. 2.5 cups of 0% Greek Yoghurt\n11. Salt and black pepper\n12. 10 homemade whole wheat pie crust discs\n13. 5 large eggs\n14. Coarse salt and black pepper for garnish\n\n**Meal Prep Steps:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 200°C (about 392°F). Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, then roast in the oven until cooked. Shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces. No rotisserie chicken nonsense – we're not cutting corners, we're cutting calories!\n\n2. While the chicken is roasting, get your knife skills going and slice the mushrooms, chop the onions, slice the carrots, mince the garlic, and chop the parsley. Now you're a chopping machine!\n\n3. Heat a bloody big pot over medium heat with a little bit of olive oil. Add onions and carrots and sauté until softened. Mushrooms and garlic join the party next. Keep the heat constant and stir occasionally until the mushrooms soften up.\n\n4. Sprinkle the flour over the veggies and stir for about 2 minutes. You're making a basic roux here – focus on that beautiful golden colour.\n\n5. Pour in the chicken broth and bring the mixture to simmer. Cook for another minute or until it forms a thick gravy-like consistency. \n\n6. Stir in Greek yoghurt, shredded chicken, frozen peas, and fresh parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let this filling cool slightly.\n\n7. Roll out 5 of your whole wheat pie crust discs into a 12-inch diameter circle. Transfer each one into a 9-inch pie pan. Make sure it hangs a bit over the edges – don't be stingy!\n\n8. Fill each pie pan with the cooled chicken mixture and spread evenly. \n\n9. Roll out the remaining 5 pie crust discs into 10-inch diameter circles. Place these on top of the filling in each pie pan. Tuck the top crust under the bottom crust and crimp the edges. \n\n10. Cut a few slits into each pie to allow steam to escape. Brush each pie with a beaten egg and sprinkle some coarse salt and black pepper on top for added crunch.\n\n11. Bake the pies in the oven for about 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown. Keep an eye on these beauties – if they're browning too quickly, create a foil shield to prevent burning.\n\n12. Allow the pies to cool for about 15 minutes before slicing. I know you're drooling by now, but trust me, you'll avoid a burnt tongue.\n\n**Storage and Reheating:**\n\nOnce the pies have cooled completely, cut each pie into your preferred portion sizes. Store these slices in airtight containers in the fridge. When you're ready to eat, reheat the slices in the microwave until piping hot, usually around 2-3 minutes. Don't overcook it, we're reheating, not bloody cremating!\n\nAnd there you have it – a healthier, meal-prep friendly version of chicken pot pie. Enjoy, you donkey!",
      "feedback": "The original recipe by Natasha is approachable and easy to follow, which makes it suitable for home cooks of all levels. She provides clear instructions on how to prep the ingredients and make the dish. The use of a rotisserie chicken is a smart shortcut for those who want to save time, and the homemade pie crust adds a nice touch.\n\nHowever, there are areas that could be improved. Starting with the ingredients, the use of heavy cream and butter in her recipe increases the fat content significantly. On the cooking technique side, a more detailed description of the desired texture or color at each cooking stage would be helpful for less experienced cooks. Moreover, the recipe lacks the nutritional information and portion control, which are essential for those who are health-conscious or on a diet.\n\nGordon Ramsay's improvements are both practical and beneficial. He replaces the rotisserie chicken with roasted chicken breasts, which are leaner and healthier. This choice also gives the cook more control over the flavor and seasoning. Moreover, he uses Greek yogurt instead of heavy cream to create a creamy texture with less fat and more protein. His use of whole wheat pie crusts not only adds fiber to the dish but also gives it a richer, nuttier flavor.\n\nRamsay's recipe is designed for meal prep, which is perfect for those who like to prepare meals ahead. His detailed instructions on storage and reheating ensure the dish can be enjoyed at its best even after a few days. The switch from butter to olive oil and the increase in vegetables also make his version healthier with less saturated fat and more fiber.\n\nIn conclusion, while both recipes have their merits, Ramsay's improvements make the dish healthier and more suitable for meal prep without sacrificing the delicious flavor of the classic chicken pot pie. His version is a great example of how small changes in ingredients and cooking techniques can make a significant difference in nutrition and healthiness.",

      "instructions": "Enhanced Instructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven: Begin by preheating your oven to 200°C (approximately 392°F) for at least 15 minutes to ensure it reaches the correct temperature.\n\n2. Prepare the chicken: Season both sides of five chicken breasts with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and roast in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Once cooked, allow them to cool slightly before shredding into bite-sized pieces. This method ensures you have lean, low-calorie protein.\n\n3. Prepare the vegetables: While the chicken is roasting, finely slice 500g of button mushrooms, chop 5 medium-sized onions, slice 5 medium-sized carrots, mince 10 cloves of garlic, and chop a handful of fresh parsley. These are your key aromatics and will build the flavor base of your pies.\n\n4. Begin building the filling: Heat a large pot over medium heat with two tablespoons of olive oil. Add the chopped onions and carrots, sautéing for about 5 minutes or until they begin to soften. Add the sliced mushrooms and minced garlic, and continue to cook for another 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms soften and release their juices.\n\n5. Make the roux: Sprinkle 5 tablespoons of flour evenly over the sautéed vegetables, stirring continuously for about 2 minutes until a paste forms and reaches a golden brown color. This roux will help thicken your filling.\n\n6. Add the liquid: Slowly pour in 5 cups of low-sodium chicken broth, stirring constantly to blend with the roux. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and allow it to cook for 5 minutes or until it forms a thick, gravy-like consistency.\n\n7. Finish the filling: Stir in 2.5 cups of Greek yogurt, the shredded chicken, 2.5 cups of frozen peas, and the chopped parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Allow this filling to cool for about 10-15 minutes.\n\n8. Prepare the pie crusts: Roll out 5 whole wheat pie crust discs into 12-inch diameter circles. Gently transfer each one into a 9-inch pie pan, ensuring it hangs slightly over the edges. This extra overhang will help seal the pies.\n\n9. Fill the pies: Evenly distribute the cooled chicken mixture among the pie crusts, spreading it out to ensure an even layer.\n\n10. Top the pies: Roll out the remaining 5 pie crust discs into 10-inch diameter circles. Place these on top of the filling in each pie pan. Tuck the top crust under the bottom crust and crimp the edges to seal.\n\n11. Finish and bake: Cut a few slits into each pie to allow steam to escape. Brush each pie with a beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse salt and black pepper. Bake the pies in the oven for about 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. If the pies begin to brown too quickly, cover them loosely with a piece of aluminium foil.\n\n12. Cool and serve: Allow the pies to cool for about 15 minutes before slicing. This resting time will allow the filling to set and prevent you from burning your tongue. Enjoy your delicious homemade chicken pot pies.",

      "storage": "Enhanced Instructions:\n\n1. **Storing Chicken Pot Pie Portions**: After your chicken pot pies have cooled completely to room temperature, carefully cut each pie into the desired portion sizes - typically, you'd get about 5 portions per pie. Allow for the portions to cool completely before proceeding to the next step. This is crucial to avoid condensation inside the storage container which can make the crust soggy. \n\n2. **Recommended Storage Containers and Methods**: Store these individual portions in high-quality, airtight containers. Glass containers with secure lids are highly recommended because they are less likely to hold onto odors and stains, and they are more durable than plastic. If you do use plastic containers, make sure they are BPA-free. To help preserve the crust's texture, consider placing a piece of parchment paper between the pie and the container. \n\n3. **Reheating Instructions**: \n\n   - **Microwave**: Place the portion on a microwave-safe plate and heat it on medium power for about 2-3 minutes. Check the temperature in the center of the pie to ensure it's thoroughly heated. If it's not hot enough, continue heating in 30-second increments until it reaches the desired temperature. \n\n   - **Oven**: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). Place the pie portion on a baking sheet and heat for approximately 15-20 minutes, or until the pie is heated through. Using an oven can help maintain the pie's crusty texture better than a microwave.\n\n4. **Maintaining Quality and Safety during Storage**: Always ensure your hands, utensils, and containers are clean before handling food to prevent contamination. Make sure the pies are completely cool before storing to prevent the growth of bacteria and to keep the crust from becoming soggy. Do not leave the pies at room temperature for more than 2 hours. Always use airtight containers to keep the food fresh and to prevent it from absorbing odors from other foods in the fridge. \n\n5. **Storage Duration**: Your chicken pot pie portions can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. If you need to store them for a longer period, you can freeze them. In a freezer kept at 0 degrees Fahrenheit or below, these portions will maintain their best quality for about 2-3 months, but they will remain safe to eat beyond this period if kept continuously frozen. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating."
