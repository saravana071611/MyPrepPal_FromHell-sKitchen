  "cookingInstructions": "1. Right, let's get started on this bloody beautiful Chicken Stir Fry! Take a sharp knife to that chicken, and think of it as your worst enemy. We want small, even pieces here. This isn't a bloody butcher shop, so let's aim for precision, not carnage.\n\n2. Now, for the marinating part. Drown those chicken pieces in soy sauce. Remember, it's not a quick hi and bye situation. We need them to soak up all the flavors, so let them sit for a while. Meanwhile, time for a little clean-as-you-go.\n\n3. On to the veggies. Look at those bell peppers, the broccoli, and the carrots. You're not just chopping them, you're showing them who's boss. It's about size and uniformity. We're cooking, not hacking apart a crime scene. \n\n4. Get that wok flaming hot and add your oil. This isn't a bloody spa day, don't be shy with the heat. Flames equal flavor, so you want to see those dancing about under your wok.\n\n5. Let's get down to the business - add the chicken to the wok. We want it nicely golden and crispy. Don't you dare overcook it. Remember, we're not making rubber, we're making Stir Fry!\n\n6. It's vegetable time! Toss in your previously manhandled veggies, stir them around and watch them glisten in the wok. Let the flavours compliment each other for about 3-4 minutes - not too crunchy, not too soft.\n\n7. Pour in your stir fry sauce, and let it gently coat everything. We're making Stir Fry, not soup, so let it cook until it thickens up nicely. Keep stirring, you don't want to be serving charcoal stir fry do you?\n\n8. Look at what you've achieved! Now serve this masterpiece hot with rice or noodles. A simple, satisfying dinner made in your kitchen that tastes better than any bloody takeout. \n\nRemember, perfecting a dish isn't an insurmountable task - every great chef started somewhere, and it's the passion for quality and flavour that set them apart. Keep that in mind, and you'll be bloody unstoppable.",
  "mealPrepInstructions": "1. **Sunday Prep Keeps the Stress Away!** Start by dicing your bloody chicken into bite-size morsels – careful fingers out of the f*cking way! Marinate it in your soy sauce and your favourite spices - let the flavours get right in there. Roughly chop your vegetables: bell peppers, broccoli, and carrots – remember, a good knife is a chef’s best friend, invest in one! Store the prepped items separately in your fridge. They’re your bloody soldiers ready for a week of battles.\n\n2. **Stir Fry Magic, Don't Rush It**: The magic of a good stir fry is in its freshness - don't cook it all at once! In the morning or the night before a busy day, portion out what you need, heat some oil in that wok and cook your chicken until it's golden brown. Toss in your delightful array of vegetables and stir fry for another 3-4 minutes. Drown it all in your chosen stir fry sauce, let it simmer until well coated and thickened. Remember, patience is key – don’t bloody torture your food.\n\n3. **Store Wisely, My Friends**: Prepare your fresh stir-fry in batches and divide it into meal prep containers. I don't care if they're glass, silicone or even Transformer themed, as long as they're airtight! Ladies and gents, this isn't rocket science – hot foods first in your containers and rice or noodles following. Seal them up tight and pop them in the fridge. \n\n4. **Reheating, Not a Bloody Secondary Cooking**: Ready for a quick reheating? Remove your container from the fridge and let it come to bloody room temperature! Microwave your stir-fry on medium for 2-3 minutes, ensuring it's hot all the way through - nothing worse than biting into a chilled middle. \n\n5. **Long-Term Storage**: If you're thinking weeks, not days in advance, then freeze those pre-cooked stir-fries. Store them in freezer and microwave-safe containers, layering the sauce, chicken and vegetables on top of the rice or noodles. Make sure they're absolutely, positively cold before you freeze them – you don't want bloody frost bite in your stir-fry.\n\n6. **Freshness Timeline**: Your hard bloody work will last 4 days in the fridge, 1 month in the freezer, for optimal quality. Past that, you're pushing your luck. Serving food is an art, don't put yesterday's sh*t on a pedestal! \n\nRemember, good food doesn't happen by bloody accident. It’s all about prep, passion, and a little bit of pizzazz. Now get in that kitchen and make magic!",
  "gordonReview": "Bloody hell, where's the seasoning, mate? You can't just rely on soy sauce and a mystery \"stir fry sauce\". And marinating the chicken in soy sauce without a dash of ginger or garlic? That's appalling! I won't even mention the stir-frying of vegetables with no mention of salt or pepper. Chicken stir fry with vegetables? More like a tedious trio of blandness!"
