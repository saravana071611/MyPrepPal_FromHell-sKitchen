      "gordonFeedback": "Come on, let's tear this apart and turn it into a real masterpiece. Chicken pot pie? More like chicken \"not pie\", right? Natasha's got some serious dedication, I'll give her that, but there are a few things we can change to make this recipe healthier, more efficient for meal prep, and let's be honest, a bit more bloody exciting.\n\nFirst off, we've got to address this whole rotisserie chicken business. For a healthier version, I'm going for skinless boneless chicken breasts. And no, we're not shredding it like a dull Sunday roast. We'll be dicing these beauties into bite-sized pieces for a better texture and easier meal prep.\n\nThe mushrooms stay, but eight ounces? More like 10 ounces! The more veg, the better.\n\nNow, this pie crust... It's essentially a slab of butter. Let's cut some of that out and replace it with whole wheat flour. We'll also use extra virgin olive oil to lower the unhealthy fats whilst adding a bit of a flavor boost.\n\nAs for the heavy whipping cream, we're swapping that out for 1% milk. We'll still get a beautiful creamy texture, but with much less fat.\n\nThe grocery list pans out as follows:\n    \n* 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n* 8 ounces of baby carrots\n* 1 large onion\n* 10 ounces of mushrooms\n* 3 cloves of garlic\n* 1/4 cup of fresh parsley\n* 1 cup of frozen peas\n* 8 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil\n* 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth\n* 1/2 cup of 1% milk\n* 2 teaspoons of salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper\n* 5 whole wheat flour pie crust discs\n* 1 large egg (free-range, you donut!)\n\nAlright, let's get down to the nitty-gritty!\n\n1. Prep your veg: mince the garlic, dice the onion, thinly slice the carrots and mushrooms. Then, dice the chicken into bite-size pieces. No lazy shortcuts here!\n\n2. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot. Add your onions, carrots, mushrooms and minced garlic. Saute for about 8 minutes and revel in the symphony of flavors.\n\n3. Sprinkle 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour over the veggies. Cook it out for a couple of minutes to create a roux bursting with flavor.\n\n4. Slowly add the chicken broth and milk, stirring constantly. This isn't store bought gravy; we're looking for a thick, luscious sauce.\n\n5. Season the sauce with salt and black pepper. Then add the chicken, peas, and parsley. Give that a stir and let it simmer until the chicken is cooked.\n\n6. Roll out your pie crusts to fit your 9-inch pie pan. Fill the crusts with the mixture and top with another pie crust. Crimp the edges, cut a few slits in the top, brush with a beaten egg, and voila!\n\nWe're doing meal prep, so this recipe makes FIVE pies. Cook them all, let them cool, then store them in the fridge. To reheat, simply bake at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes. \n\nAnd there you have it: a healthier, meal prep-friendly chicken pot pie that's absolutely stunning. That's how you make a chicken pot pie Gordon Ramsay style, beautiful!",
      "groceryList": "**GORDON RAMSAY'S AUTHENTIC, PRECISE, AND QUALITY-INSISTENT SHOPPING LIST**\n\n**Meat Department:**\n- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (organic, free-range - don't compromise here!)\n\n**Chef's note:** Look for chicken breasts that are firm to touch, pinkish in color and do not have a strong smell. Avoid any that are discoloured or have a foul smell.\n\n**Produce Department:**\n- 8 ounces of baby carrots (fresh and vibrant in colour)\n- 1 large onion (firm, no soft spots or sprouting)\n- 10 ounces of fresh mushrooms (firm, no slimy spots)\n- 3 cloves of garlic (firm, no sprouting)\n- 1/4 cup of parsley (fresh, vibrant green, no wilting)\n- 1 cup of frozen peas (yes, frozen! They're picked at peak ripeness)\n\n**Chef's note:** When choosing mushrooms, opt for ones that are firm with a smooth appearance. They should feel dry, not wet or slimy.\n\n**Dairy Department:**\n- 1/2 cup of 1% milk (fresh, unexpired, no lumps!)\n- 1 large egg (free-range, you donut!)\n\n**Chef's note:** For the milk, go for organic if possible.

This allows you to control the salt content of your meal. Also, organic broth tends to have a richer flavor.\n\n**Spices & Seasonings:**\n- 2 teaspoons of salt (sea salt or kosher)\n- 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper (freshly ground)\n\n**Chef's note:** Freshly ground black pepper is always best.

This method of extraction preserves the oil's flavor and nutritional benefits.\n\n**Now, get out there and shop like you mean it!**",
      "cookingMethod": "Right, you donkeys, let's put some bloody heart into it and get this done. We're making chicken pot pies that are so good, your taste buds will think they've died and gone to culinary heaven. No piss-poor shortcuts, this is proper cooking. \n\n1. First off, get off your arse and prep your veg. Mince the garlic like you're on a mission, dice the onion like a pro, slice the carrots and mushrooms so thin they're practically invisible. And don't even think about hacking the chicken - dice it into bite-size pieces, each one a perfect morsel. \n\n2. Now, heat 2 tablespoons of quality olive oil in a hefty pot. Not some piss-ant little saucepan, I'm talking a pot that means business. Chuck in your onions, carrots, mushrooms, and the minced garlic. Saute for exactly 8 minutes. No less, no more. You want to create a bloody symphony of flavors, not some half-arsed tune.\n\n3. Next, sprinkle 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour over your veg. This isn't some namby-pamby dusting, we're creating a roux here, packed with flavours. Cook it out for a solid 2 minutes.\n\n4. Now listen up, this bit's crucial. Gradually add the chicken broth and milk, stirring like your life depends on it. This isn't some supermarket gravy mix; we're aiming for a sauce so thick and luscious, it'd make a food critic weep.\n\n5. Season that beautiful sauce with salt and black pepper. Then throw in the chicken, peas, and parsley. Give it a good stir and let the lot simmer until that chicken is cooked through. No bloody raw chicken here.\n\n6. Now for the pie crusts. You've got to roll them out to fit a 9-inch pie pan. Don't balls it up. Fill that crust with the mixture, then top it with another crust. Crimp the edges, cut a few slits in the top, brush with a beaten egg, and there you have it! \n\nNow remember, we're prepping for five, so repeat this process until you've got FIVE stunning pies. Cook them all, let them cool down (no one likes a soggy bottom), then store the beauties in the fridge. When you're ready to reheat, just bang them in the oven at 375 degrees F for exactly 25 minutes. \n\nAnd there you have it, my take on a healthier, meal prep-friendly chicken pot pie that's not just good, it's bloody brilliant. That's how you make a chicken pot pie, Ramsay-style, you muppets!"
