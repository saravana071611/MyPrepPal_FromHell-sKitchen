  "raw": "Right. Let's get cracking, shall we?\n\nFirst off, kudos to you for attempting a healthy meal prep. There's nothing quite like having a nutritious meal ready when you're starving after a long day. But, this recipe could use a bit more excitement, a bit of refinement, and a bloody good punch of flavour.\n\nLet's make this not just healthier, but absolutely lip-smacking good! We're going to turn this into a five-star meal prep recipe that you'd be thrilled to eat all week. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1. Chicken breast - 1.25 kilos. Yes, we're bulking up on the protein.\n2. Sea salt - as per taste. It's subtler and adds a nice touch.\n3. Black pepper, freshly ground - as per taste. Freshly ground, always.\n4. Garlic powder - 2 teaspoons. \n5. Smoked paprika - 2 teaspoons. We'll use the smoked version for that intense, smoky flavour.\n6. Olive oil, extra virgin - 5 tablespoons. None of that cheap stuff, please.\n7. Onions - 5 medium-sized, finely chopped. \n8. Garlic cloves - 10, finely minced.\n9. Bell peppers - 2 red, 2 yellow, finely sliced. More veggies, more colour.\n10. Broccoli florets - 500 grams. Don't be stingy on the greens!\n11. Carrots - 5 medium-sized, matchstick cut. Extra veg never hurt anyone.\n12. Low-sodium Soy sauce - 5 tablespoons. Keeps the sodium levels in check.\n13. Raw honey - 5 tablespoons. Adds a natural sweetness.\n14. Sriracha or any hot sauce - 5 teaspoons. It's optional, but who doesn't love a bit of a kick?\n15. Quinoa - 2.5 cups (uncooked). It's more nutritious than brown rice, rich in protein and fibre.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Let's get started. Season the chicken breasts on both sides with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, garlic powder, and smoked paprika. Let it sit for a bit to soak in the flavours.\n\n2. While the chicken is marinating, prep your vegetables. Finely chop the onions, mince the garlic, slice the bell peppers, cut the carrots into matchsticks and prep the broccoli florets. Keep everything organised, it's not a bloody tip!\n\n3. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken and hear that satisfying sizzle. Cook it for about 5-6 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through. Remember, no pink in the middle!\n\n4. Remove the chicken and let it rest. Pro tip: always let your meat rest!\n\n5. In the same pan, add another tablespoon of olive oil. Toss in the onions and garlic, and sauté for about 2 minutes until fragrant. Then, throw in the bell peppers, carrots, and broccoli. Stir fry for another 5 minutes until the veg starts to soften but still has a crunch. It's not a bloody stew!\n\n6. While the vegetables are cooking, slice the rested chicken into strips. Add it back to the pan with the vegetables. \n\n7. Time to add a splash of soy sauce, a drizzle of honey, and a dash of sriracha. Feel free to adjust the quantities to your taste. Stir that beauty in.\n\n8. Meanwhile, cook the quinoa according to the package instructions. \n\n9. For serving, divide the quinoa and stir-fried chicken and vegetables evenly into 5 containers. \n\nYou've got yourself five delicious, healthy meals packed full of protein, loaded with vegetables, and brought alive with flavours. Be sure to store these containers in the refrigerator. They'll keep for up to 5 days. When it's time to eat, just reheat in a microwave until hot, but don't turn it into molten lava, for heaven's sake! Enjoy!",
  "feedback": "The original recipe is straightforward and does provide a balanced, healthy meal. It uses simple and accessible ingredients, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow. The use of various vegetables adds color, texture, and nutritional value. The addition of soy sauce, honey, and sriracha gives the dish a balance of sweet, salty, and spicy flavors. \n\nHowever, in terms of technique and ingredients, there are several areas for improvement. The chicken is cooked first and set aside, which could potentially lead to it becoming dry and overcooked when added back to the pan. Also, the vegetables are added at the same time, which does not consider their respective cooking times, potentially leading to unevenly cooked vegetables. Regarding ingredients, the recipe could be more specific about the type and amount of salt, pepper, and other seasonings used. \n\nGordon Ramsay’s improvements are beneficial in several ways. He increases the amount of protein and vegetables, which adds nutritional value and portion size. He also specifies the type and amount of ingredients to use, which helps ensure flavor consistency. His use of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, in particular, can enhance the flavor of the chicken. The use of smoked paprika instead of regular paprika adds a smoky flavor to the dish, which can make it more appetizing. \n\nRamsay's cooking instructions also reflect his years of culinary expertise. He suggests letting the chicken marinate for a while to absorb the flavors, which can improve the taste. He also emphasizes allowing the chicken to rest after cooking, which can help retain its juices and make it more tender. In addition, he recommends adding vegetables according to their cooking times, which would lead to better texture and flavor. \n\nIn terms of health considerations, Ramsay’s version is healthier due to the increased quantities of protein and vegetables. He also substitutes quinoa for brown rice, which is more nutritious, being high in protein and fiber. His use of extra virgin olive oil and raw honey are healthier choices too. The use of low-sodium soy sauce helps control the sodium content of the meal, which is beneficial for people with high blood pressure or other sodium-sensitive conditions. \n\nOverall, Ramsay's revised recipe provides a more flavorful, nutritious, and well-balanced meal. His attention to detail in both ingredients and cooking techniques demonstrates his expertise as a professional chef and his commitment to creating delicious and healthy meals.",

  "storage": "**Storage Instructions:**\n\n1. **Containers:** Use BPA-free, microwavable, and freezer-safe food storage containers. Each container should have a tight-fitting lid to prevent leakage and maintain freshness. Glass containers are ideal as they do not absorb smells and are easy to clean.\n\n2. **Cooling:** Before storing the chicken pot pies, make sure they cool down completely at room temperature. This prevents steam from getting trapped in the container which can lead to soggy food and bacterial growth.\n\n3. **Portioning:** Divide the quinoa and stir-fried chicken and vegetables evenly into the 5 containers. This makes reheating easier and ensures even flavor distribution.\n\n4. **Refrigeration:** If you plan to consume the pot pies within 5 days, store them in the refrigerator. Place the containers in the middle or upper shelves where the temperature is most consistent.\n\n5. **Freezing:** If you want to store the pot pies for longer, you can freeze them. They can be safely stored in the freezer for up to 2 months. To prevent freezer burn, wrap the containers in aluminum foil or place them in freezer bags.\n\n**Reheating Instructions:**\n\n1. **Microwave:** Remove the lid and loosely cover the container with a microwave-safe plate or microwave cover to avoid splattering. Heat on high for 2-3 minutes, stir, then continue heating for another 1-2 minutes or until the food is heated thoroughly. Let it stand for a minute before eating.\n\n2. **Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Transfer the food to an oven-safe dish and cover it with aluminum foil to prevent it from drying out. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until heated through. \n\n**Tips for Maintaining Quality and Safety during Storage:**\n\n1. Always wash your hands and ensure all utensils and containers are clean before handling food.\n\n2. Make sure to cool down the food at room temperature before storing it to prevent bacterial growth.\n\n3. Do not leave the food out at room temperature for more than 2 hours. After this time, bacteria can start to multiply rapidly.\n\n4. If storing in the freezer, ensure that your freezer is set to 0°F (-18°C) or below.\n\n5. Always reheat the food until it's steaming hot throughout to kill any potential bacteria.\n\n6. Never refreeze a meal that has been previously frozen and reheated. \n\n7. If you notice any off smells, changes in texture, or mold, discard the food immediately. It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to food safety."
