Hello everyone, welcome to my cooking channel. Today I'm going to show you how to make a delicious and healthy meal that's perfect for meal prep.

We'll start with some chicken breast, about 500 grams. Season it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat.

While the pan is heating, let's chop one onion, two cloves of garlic, and some bell peppers - one red and one yellow for color. Also prepare some broccoli florets and slice two medium carrots.

Once the pan is hot, add the chicken and cook for about 5-6 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken and set aside.

In the same pan, add the onions and garlic. SautÃ© for about 2 minutes until fragrant. Then add the bell peppers, carrots, and broccoli. Cook for another 5 minutes until vegetables start to soften but still have some crunch.

Now, slice the chicken into strips and add it back to the pan with the vegetables. Add a splash of soy sauce, a tablespoon of honey, and a teaspoon of sriracha for some heat. Stir everything together.

For serving, prepare some brown rice or quinoa. This recipe makes about 4-5 portions, perfect for your weekly meal prep. Each portion has approximately 30 grams of protein, 45 grams of carbs, and 12 grams of fat.
